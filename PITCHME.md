# Outline

1. I had a problem
2. Almost all my plants were dead
3. But I wanted one of them to survive
4. This is Zdzislaw. He is a Venus flytrap. He likes bugs. Wants to be a software tester.
5. I want to keep him alive.
6. I tried reminders
7. But usualy there were something more urgent to do
8. There must be something wrong about plants
9. Because I had never had such problems with animals
10. This is Fado.
11. When he is hungry he knows what to do.
12. He kicks his bowl, so it slides across the floor and makes a lot of noise.
13. Fado can communicate, Zdzislaw can'd do it.
14. Let's help Zdzislaw communicate
15. What do we need?
16. A pinch of overengineering, ignorance towards 10,000 years of agriculture history, some equipement I will use only once
17. First, I connected the Arduino to WiFi
18. Then I tried using the sensors
19. The problems with cheap sensors.
20. Unstable measurements + what is the unit? or the range of values?
21. Figuring out the measurement thresholds
22. Using the water pump
23. Do you see the problem?
24. This thing is huge
26. I have never promised that this story is going to have a happy ending.
27. It was too late for Zdzislaw
28. Zdzislaw 2.0
29. This time it is going to be different.
30. I mean... I will kill a different plant.
31. What is the point of all of that?
32. The same as in every overengineered project - engineering fun
33. Engineering fun = (challange + learning) * satisfaction**hype
34. It is ok to have fun, but please do it in a harmless side project
