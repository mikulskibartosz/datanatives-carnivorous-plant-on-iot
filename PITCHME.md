# I had a problem

# All of my plants were dead

Picture 2

# But there was one

---

# This is Zdzislaw

---

# I wanted Zdzislaw to survive

---

# Zdzislaw

@css[fragment](* Venus flytrap)
@css[fragment](* likes bugs)
@css[fragment](* wants to be a software tester)

---

# I wanted to keep Zdzislaw alive

---

# I tried reminders

## But usually there were something more urgent to do

---

## Later == Never

---

# There must be something wrong about plants

---

# I have never had such problems with animals

---

# This is Fado

Picture

---

# When he is hungry, he know what to do

--- 

# He kicks his bowl and makes a lot of noise

---

# Fado can communicate
# Zdzislaw can't do that

---

# Let's help Zdzislaw communicate with people

---

# What do we need?

# Connecting Arduino to WiFi

---

# Using sensors

# The problem with cheap sensors

---

# Figuring out the measurement thresholds

---

# Using the water pump

---

# This thing is huge

---

# I have never promised that this story is going to have a happy ending

---
# It was too late for Zdzislaw

---

# Zdzislaw 2.0

---


# This time it is going to be different.

---

## I mean... I will kill a different plant.

---

# What is the point of all of that?

---

# What is the most important thing in an IoT project?

---

# If this thing could talk, what would it say?

---

# I put a carnivorous plant on the Internet of Things to save its life
## ... and I failed ;)
